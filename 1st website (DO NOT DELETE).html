        My name is Jocelyn! 
        I'm an International Studies major
        with a concentration in International Commerce
        and a minor in Cybersecurity!
        <p>
        I was born and raised in Houston, TX; 
        I love to try new restaurants 
        from all around the world!
        </p>
        Fun fact: I'm learning my third language,
        Japanese, and I'm currently learning Python.

        My interests include learning about different cultures, 
        going to the gym, arts and crafts, videogames, golf, 
        and trying new things!
